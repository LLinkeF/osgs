sudo dnf install sphinx
pip3 install --upgrade myst-parser
pip3 install git+https://github.com/bashtage/sphinx-material.git

See https://bashtage.github.io/sphinx-material/#getting-started for theme specific info.

See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html for Markdown in Sphinx support notes (and the docs at https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html). Especially, note the admonitions docs which are used to make little alert etc boxes in the docs:  https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html#html-admonitions
