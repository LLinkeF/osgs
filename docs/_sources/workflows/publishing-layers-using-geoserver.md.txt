# Publishing layers using Geoserver

This workflow will demonstrate the following:

* Basic configuration of Geoserver using a shapefile store (a directory of shapefiles)
* Uploading one or more shapefiles to the server using the scp drop zone for Geoserver
* Registering the layers
* Publishing the layers as basic WMS layers
