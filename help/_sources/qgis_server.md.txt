# QGIS Server

You should read the [QGIS Server documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/server_manual/getting_started.html#) on QGIS.org. It is well written and covers a lot of background explanation which is not provided here. Also you should familiarise yourself with the [Environment Variables](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/server_manual/config.html#environment-variables).

Alesandro Passoti has made a number of great resources available for QGIS Server. See his [workshop slide deck](http://www.itopen.it/bulk/FOSS4G-IT-2020/#/presentation-title) and his [server side plugin examples](https://github.com/elpaso/qgis3-server-vagrant/tree/master/resources/web/plugins), and [more examples here](https://github.com/elpaso/qgis-helloserver).

## QGIS Server Atlas Print Plugin

See the [project documentation](https://github.com/3liz/qgis-atlasprint/blob/master/atlasprint/README.md#api) for supported request parameters for QGIS Atlas prints.
